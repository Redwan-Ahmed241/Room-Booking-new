# NeoScape Properties LTD

NeoScape Properties LTD is a web App property management  internal admin use. The current codebase focuses on managing properties, rooms, media, documents, rent schedules, and admin access flows. It is not a public guest-booking site in its current state.

## Current Scope

The app currently provides:

- A video-based landing page with calls to action for admin login and management access.
- Admin authentication flows for login, sign-up, forgot-password, and reset-password.
- A protected admin area with role-based access control.
- Property grouping by location, with each location treated as a villa/property bucket.
- Room CRUD for each property.
- Room detail editing with images, documents, availability toggles, and rent/payment tracking.
- A management dashboard for rent schedules, room documents, property images, and property documents.
- Backend API integration with partial graceful fallback where the UI can still load partial data.

## Functional Areas

### Landing Page

The landing page is a full-screen hero with a video background, animated headline, and CTA buttons. It gives quick entry points into the admin area rather than exposing guest-facing search or booking features.

### Authentication

The auth system is centered around `AuthContext` and `useAuth`.

- Login and logout are managed through the app auth context.
- Admin routes are protected by role checks.
- Non-admin users are blocked from the protected area.
- The login, sign-up, forgot-password, and reset-password pages are all standalone flows.

### Property Management

`VillaListPage` loads rooms, groups them by property/location, and shows summary cards for each property.

- Add a new property.
- View room counts, available rooms, and occupied rooms.
- Open a property to see its rooms.

### Room Management

`VillaRoomsPage` handles room management inside a selected property.

- Add a room to a property.
- Delete a room.
- View room price and basic details.
- Open room details for deeper editing.

### Room Detail Management

`RoomDetailPage` is the main operational screen for a single room.

- Edit room name, description, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, size, and amenities.
- Toggle availability between to-let and occupied.
- Upload and remove room images.
- Upload and delete room documents.
- Record rent payments.
- View rent schedule and document data linked to the room.

### Management Dashboard

`ManagementPage` bundles the operational tools in one place.

- Rent Scheduler
